# Coding Standards and Guidelines


Good software development organizations want their programmers to maintain to some well-defined and standard style of coding called coding standards.


##  Purpose of Having Coding Standards:

* A coding standard gives a uniform appearance to the codes written by different engineers.
* It improves readability, and maintainability of the code and it reduces complexity also.
* It helps in code reuse and helps to detect error easily.
* It promotes sound programming practices and increases efficiency of the programmers.

--------------------------------------------------
### Avoid using a coding style that is too difficult to understand:
`Code should be easily understandable. The complex code makes maintenance and debugging difficult and expensive.`

--------------------------------------------------
### Length of functions should not be very large:
`Lengthy functions are very difficult to understand. Thatâ€™s why functions should be small enough to carry out small work and lengthy functions should be broken into small ones for completing small tasks.`

--------------------------------------------------
### Commenting and Documentation:

Commenting the code is very important. People can't read other people's minds. Commenting serves two purposes:
1. to ensure that the code is written as desired. This form of comment is usually put in the code before the code is written. It serves as a means of ensuring that the code does what it is supposed to do.
2. to ensure that the code is described in sufficient detail such that anyone else looking at the code can easily understand the design and the purpose of the code.
