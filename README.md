# Coding Standards and Guidelines
=========================
Good software development organizations want their programmers to maintain to some well-defined and standard style of coding called coding standards.


##  Purpose of Having Coding Standards:

* A coding standard gives a uniform appearance to the codes written by different engineers.
* It improves readability, and maintainability of the code and it reduces complexity also.
* It helps in code reuse and helps to detect error easily.
* It promotes sound programming practices and increases efficiency of the programmers.

========================================================================================
### Avoid using a coding style that is too difficult to understand:
`Code should be easily understandable. The complex code makes maintenance and debugging difficult and expensive.`
